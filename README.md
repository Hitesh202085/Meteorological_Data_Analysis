# Meteorological Data Analysis

In this project we’re going to perform analysis of Meteorological data. Our goal of this project is to transform the raw data into information and then convert that information into knowledge.

A null hypothesis to be considered is : “Ho : Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming”.

The Ho means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.
